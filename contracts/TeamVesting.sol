 * The aim is to provide a vesting contract that fits completely into NCDT's vesting terms and conditions.
 * With every sold and minted token the same amount goes into this vesting contract.
 * The vesting contract holds multiple vestors where all vested tokens can get released by diverse rates, e.g:
 * Vestor 1 with 93% of vesting token  and Vestor 2 with 7 % of vesting token (referring to the NUCO-Whitepaper)
 *
 * Sold Token
